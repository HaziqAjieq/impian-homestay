      "description": "I had a fantastic stay at this Airbnb! The space was clean, cozy, and exactly as described. The host was incredibly welcoming and responsive, making sure I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. The location was perfect‚Äîclose to the airport yet in a quiet neighborhood. Just for long car like big SUV or van, I found it is a bit difficult to park inside. But you can also park outside.I highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again!"
